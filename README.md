# Post-Surgery-_Lung-Cancer-Survival_rate_Prediction

Problem Statement 

Traditional methods for predicting post-surgery survival rates rely on factors such as pain before surgery, dyspnoea, Type 2 diabetes, and other clinical indicators. While these assessments are valuable, they are often time-consuming and may lack precision. This project introduces a machine learning-based approach to improve the accuracy and efficiency of survival predictions following lung surgery.

By analyzing patient data through various ML models, the system can determine survival likelihood with greater consistency. The models used in this project include:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

This approach aims to support medical professionals with data-driven insights, enhancing decision-making and patient care.
