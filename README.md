# Post-Surgery-_Lung-Cancer-Survival_

Problem Statement 
Traditional method vs Machine learning detecting Post-surgerysurvival rate:
The traditional methods of detectingpost-surgerysurvival ratesinclude factors such aspain beforesurgery, Dyspnoea Before Surgery, Type2Diabetes, and so on.All factors are considered by doctorswhen determining whether someone cansurvive post-surgery.However, these traditional diagnosticmethods aretime-consuming and the accuracy is alsolow.The machine learning model, on the otherhand, takes all parameters andaccurately detectswhether a person can survive post-lung surgery.© INSAID All rights reserved.
ML algorithms that can be used for detecting Post-surgery survival rate:Logistic Regression:Logistic regression estimatesthe probability of an event occurring, such as voting ordidn’t vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, thedependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. In logistic regression, a logit transformation is appliedto the odds—that is, the probability of success divided by the probability of failure.Support Vector machines: Support Vector Machine orSVM is one of the most popular supervisedlearning algorithms used for both classification and regression problems. However, it is primarily used forclassification problems in machine learning.Decision tree classifier:A decision Tree is a Supervisedlearning technique that can be used for bothclassification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It isa tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches representthe decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.Random Forest classifier:Random Forest is a popularmachine learning algorithm that belongs tosupervised learning techniques. It can be used for both classification and regression problems in ML. It isbased on the concept of ensemble learning, where multiple classifiers are combined to solve a complexproblem and improve the performance of the model
