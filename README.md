# Post-Surgery-_Lung-Cancer-Survival_rate_Detection

Problem Statement 


Traditional method vs Machine learning in detecting Post-surgerysurvival rate:


The traditional methods of detectingpost-surgerysurvival ratesinclude factors such aspain beforesurgery, Dyspnoea Before Surgery, Type2Diabetes, and so on.All factors are considered by doctorswhen determining whether someone cansurvive post-surgery.However, these traditional diagnosticmethods aretime-consuming and the accuracy is alsolow.The machine learning model, on the otherhand, takes all parameters and accurately detects whether a person can survive post-lung surgery.
The following ML models are used to detect the Post Surgery Survival rate.
Logistic Regression
Support Vector machines
Decision tree classifier
Random Forest classifier
